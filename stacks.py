'''Stack Problem: Track the Max Item
Problem (Easy-Medium)
You're given a list of operations â€” "push X" or "pop".
Return a list of the maximum item in the stack after each operation.

Input Example
["push 1", "push 5", "push 3", "pop", "push 6"]

Expected Output (Max after each op)
[1, 5, 5, 5, 6]

Use your regular stack to hold the numbers.
Also keep a second stack to track the max so far.
Every time you push:
Add the item to the main stack.
Compare with the current max, and push the new max to the max stack.
Every time you pop:
Pop from both stacks.
After each operation, the top of the max stack gives you the current maximum.'''
