# Core “Easy” Array Problems to Try Next:
# Find the Missing Number (0 to n)

# Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]

# Output: 2

# Hint: Sum of 0 to n is n*(n+1)//2. Compare it to the sum of nums.

# Find the Single Number

# Every element appears twice except for one. Find that one.

# Example: nums = [4,1,2,1,2] → Output: 4

# Hint: Use XOR.

# Move Zeroes

# Move all 0s to the end of the array while keeping the order of non-zero elements.

# Input: [0,1,0,3,12] → Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

# Hint: Use two pointers.

# Find All Duplicates

# Input: [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1] → Output: [2,3]

# Bonus: Try without extra space (not needed at first).

# Check if Array is a Palindrome

# Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] → Output: True

# Find Second Largest Number

# What if the array has duplicates?

# Running Sum

# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4] → Output: [1, 3, 6, 10]

# Just add each element to the sum so far.

# Check if Array is Sorted (Ascending)

# Input: [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] → Output: True

# Insert an Element at a Specific Index

# Modify a list by inserting a number at a position (without using insert()).

# Rotate Array Right by K

# Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 → Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
